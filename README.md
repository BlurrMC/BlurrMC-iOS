# What is BlurrMC?
You might be asking right now, what is BlurrMC? BlurrMC is a social media platform created by Martin Velev. This platform is a 7 second long video app. It lets you see what is trending, what the people you follow post, and lets you upload a video. There are no algorithms to make it so that anyone that is trending is simply trending regardless of who they are or what they are doing. There are no songs included for you to pick from and the only way to add sounds is by using an external application. This version of BlurrMC is only for iOS and is fully hosted on CloudKit.

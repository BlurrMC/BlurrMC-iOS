# BlurrMC for iOS
This is the BlurrMC social media platform for IOS! WOOOOOOO!
On this version of the social media platform, you have the full featured version of Blurred.
## Note:
BlurrMC is now a defunct social media platform. I'll still accept merge requests and any plans to try and bring it "back to life", but I'm not gonna be maintaing this personally. All hosting for BlurrMC has also been stopped, so don't run the app and then come back to me asking why it no work. If you really would like to run this app, make sure to change every single "https://blurrmc.com" reference to wherever you are hosting BlurrMC's web app.

# What is BlurrMC?
You might be asking right now, what is BlurrMC? BlurrMC is a social media platform created by Martin Velev. This platform is a 7 second long video app. It lets you see what is trending, what the people you follow post, and lets you upload a video. There are no algorithms to make it so that anyone that is trending is simply trending regardless of who they are or what they are doing. There are no songs included for you to pick from and the only way to add sounds is by using an external application. This is a different social media platform compared to other ones like Tik Tok as an example. We have a more in depth web application system and the platform is overall better as data is not sent to the Chinese government. BlurrMC is fully self-hosted and is not depending on external providers like AWS or Asure for the most part.
